# Sandbox Playground for React

This is my version-controlled sandbox to learn and play with React.

# Project

In this sandbox, I created an mock-app that resembles streaming service Twitch.

This project practiced on Google OAuth implementation, react-router navigation, middleware, redux-form, and modals.
