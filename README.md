# Sandbox Playground for React

This is my version-controlled sandbox to play with React.

# Project Description

In this sandbox, I created an mock-app that resembles streaming service Twitch.

This project practiced on Google OAuth implementation, react-router navigation, middleware, redux-form, and modals.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to upload this app onto Netlify, since Netlify is meant for static websites. This app utilizes json-server.
